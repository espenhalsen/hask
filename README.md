## Run Locally on your machine:

Clone the HASK project to your designated folder

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/espenhalsen/hask.git
```

Go to the cloned HASK directory

```bash
  cd hask
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the HASK server

```bash
  npm start
```
Now you should be able to open the server in a browser using localhost/your ip and :3030 as the port.

## Development

To develope on the HASK project, use the command below

```bash
  npm run devStart
```
This will start a nodemon development server, which updates each time you save a file.
